        <p>Whether it be jumping the turnstile, going underneath it, or keeping the nearest emergency door open, several New York subway riders have found a way to not pay the MTA. Since city officials deployed an additional 800 transit officers across stations earlier this year through “Operation Fare Play,” thousands of riders have been arrested for fare evasions. </p>
        
        <p> After a fare evader is caught by police, they could be issued a summons to dispute the charges at a hearing or pay a $100 fine, as stated on the MTA’s Transit Adjudication Bureau website. According to the NYPD’s patrol guide, arrests related to fare evasion can be made if the evader repeated the crime after failing to respond to three or more summons issued within the last two years. </p>
        
        <p> In other cases, arrests for fare evasion are made if the rider committed other crimes in the transit system or if the transit officer has a “legitimate law enforcement purpose” along with the evasion charge.</p>

        <p> Brooklyn has consistently seen the highest number of arrests related to fare evasion, with this year marking 2,233 arrests so far, according to the NYPD’s subway fare evasion reports. The Bronx follows with 1,966 arrests this year. While Manhattan comes in third after arrests more than doubled since last year. </p>

        <p> “Everyone does it,” said a transit officer on 42 Street-Port Authority, who refused to give his name because of NYPD’s regulations. A few feet away from where the officer was patrolling, an emergency door remained open with at least two fare evaders walking through. In 2024 so far, this specific station’s transit officers have made a total of 236 arrests. </p> 

        <p> Aside from increasing police presence on subways, the MTA is replacing its turnstiles for wide-aisle gates to curb fare evasion and delaying the opening of emergency exits by 15-seconds in selected stations, per a press release. <p>
